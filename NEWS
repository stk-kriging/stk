Changes in version 1.1
======================

* New special functions for the Matern 3/2 and 5/2 correlation
  functions (stk_sf_matern32, stk_sf_matern52). New covariance
  functions (stk_materncov32_iso, stk_materncov32_aniso, ...).

* New MEX-file to compute the separation distance (stk_mindist).

* New function to generate random Latin Hypercube Samples
  (stk_sampling_randomlhs). Renamed stk_sampling_cartesiangrid to
  stk_sampling_regulargrid, and changed the meaning of the first
  argument for consistency with other stk_sampling_* functions.

* Improved stk_model function. Now provides default parameters for
  several families of covariance functions.

* Renamed fields in "model" structures (covariance_cache to Kx_cache
  and P0 to Px_cache). A new field 'dim' has been added to the 'model'
  structure.

* Changed the order of the arguments of the functions that use the
  structure 'model'. Now, 'model' is always the first argument.

* Changed stk_param_estim to make it possible to estimate noise
  variance.

* Fixed issues in stk_param_estim.m related to the definition of the
  search domain and the selection of (constrained/unconstrained)
  optimizer.

* Renamed stk_conditionning to stk_conditioning.

* New functions for a more flexible and efficient management of STK's
  configuration in stk_init (path, compilation of MEX-file, checking
  for optional packages, selection of the default optimizer, ...).

* New functions for unit testing, based on Octave's testing system
  (stk_test, stk_runtests). Tests have been added to most functions in
  the toolbox.

* Improved documentation & new examples.

* Improved argument checking and error messages.

* Improved compatibility with older versions of Octave and Matlab.

* Lots of minor changes and bug fixes.

* Complete reorganization of the code (better directory structure).
