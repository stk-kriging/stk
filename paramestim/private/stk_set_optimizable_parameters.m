% STK_SET_OPTIMIZABLE_PARAMETERS [STK internal]
%
% CALL: PARAM = stk_set_optimizable_parameters (PARAM, VALUE)
%
%    sets to VALUE the 'optimizable_parameters' property of PARAM.  The argument
%    VALUE is expected to be a numerical vector of the appropriate length.
%
% NOTE:
%
%    Numerical arrays are considered as a special kind of parameter object, for
%    which the 'optimizable_parameters' property is taken to be PARAM(:).
%
% INTERNAL FUNCTION WARNING:
%
%    This function is currently considered as internal, which is why it is
%    located in a private directory.  STK users that which to experiment with
%    parameter classes can already overload it, but should be aware that
%    API-breaking changes are likely to happen in future releases of STK.

function param = stk_set_optimizable_parameters (param, value)

% This function will catch all calls to stk_set_optimizable_parameters for which
% neither param nor value is an object of a "parameter class" (more precisely,
% a class that implements stk_set_optimizable_parameters)

try
    
    % If param is numeric, the following syntax preserves its size and type
    param(:) = value;
    
    % Note: if param is an object, the previous line is actually a call to
    % subsasgn in disguise. This way of supporting parameter objects has been
    % introduced in STK 2.0.0 as an "experimental" feature. It is now
    % deprecated.
