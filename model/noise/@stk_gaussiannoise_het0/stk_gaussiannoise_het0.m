% STK_GAUSSIANNOISE_HET0 [experimental] is an example of noise model
%
% CALL: GN = stk_gaussiannoise_het0 (VF, PHI)
%
%    creates an heteroscedastic Gaussian noise model with variance function VF
%    and dispersion PHI.  The variance at location x is given by:
%
%       tau^2 (x) = PHI * VF(x).
%
% OPTIMIZABLE PARAMETER:
%
%    PARAM(1) = log (PHI)
%
% REMARK:
%
%    The suffix "0" in the name of the class indicates that there are no
%    additional hyperparameters in the definition of the variance function
%    (in other words, the only hyperparameter is the dispersion).
%
%    This class can be used as an example of how to create noise model objects
%    by subclassing stk_gaussiannoise_.
%
% EXPERIMENTAL CLASS WARNING:  The stk_gaussiannoise_het0 class is
%    currently considered experimental.  STK users who wish to experiment with
%    it are welcome to do so, but should be aware that API-breaking changes
%    are likely to happen in future releases.  We invite them to direct any
%    questions, remarks or comments about this experimental class to the STK
%    mailing list.
