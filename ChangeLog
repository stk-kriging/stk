===  Release 1.0.2 : changes since release 1.0.1  ===
=====================================================

2012-04-22  Julien Bect  <julien.bect@supelec.fr>

	Preparing for release 1.0.2.

	* htmldoc/*: Updated HTML documentation.
	* almost-all-files: Updated headers (copyright, version).

	Fixed Octave dependencies (GLPK, optim).

	* utils/stk_check_octave_packages.m: Now checks for presence of
	the GLPK library, which is used by sqp().
	* utils/stk_check_octave_packages.m: Removed unnecessary depency
	on Octave-Forge package 'optim' (it turns out that sqp() is
	provided by Octave itself !).
	* README.txt: Updated doc.

	Fixed a bug in Octave (use of Matlab-like assert statements).

	* covfcs/stk_noisecov.m: Replaced Matlab-style assert() statements
	with explicit calls to error().

	Bugfix for compatibility with older versions of Octave---more
	precisely, of the miscellaneous package.

	* stk_init.m: use OCTAVE_VERSION instead of ver(), see below.

2012-04-21  Julien Bect  <julien.bect@supelec.fr>

	Bugfix for compatibility with older versions of Octave---more
	precisely, of the miscellaneous package.

	* utils/stk_is_octave_in_use.m: Test for the existence of built-in
	variable OCTAVE_VERSION to check if running under Octave (instead
	of calling ver(), which was not working properly with some old
	versions of the miscellaneous package).

	Doc fixing.

	* core/stk_make_matcov.m: Fixed doc (header).
	* core/stk_predict.m: idem.

2012-04-21  Emmanuel Vazquez  <emmanuel.vazquez@supelec.fr>

	Fixed two bugs related to the use of a "covariance cache": when xi
	is a vector of indices, xi.a does not exist !

	* core/stk_make_matcov.m: Bugfix.
	* core/stk_predict.m: Bugfix.

	Renamed fields in "model" structures (covariance_cache to Kx_cache
	and P0 to Px_cache).

	* core/stk_ortho_func.m: Renamed variables.
	* core/stk_make_matcov.m: idem.
	* core/stk_predict.m: idem.
	* core/stk_model.m: idem.

	Miscellaneous changes, mostly doc fixing.

	* covfcs/stk_materncov_aniso.m: Fixed doc. Renamed a variable.
	* examples/example01.m: Fixed doc (SMTK -> STK).
	* examples/example03.m: idem.

2012-02-05  Julien Bect  <julien.bect@supelec.fr>

	Fixed issues in stk_param_estim.m related to the definition of the
	search domain and the selection of (constrained/unconstrained)
	optimizer.

	* core/stk_param_estim.m: Enlarged the search domain in such a way
	that param0 is always inside it. Changed the selection of
	optimizer to use fminsearch when either the upper- or the
	lower-bound are empty. Moved the definition of the 'options'
	struct to the Matlab-specific part of the code.

	Doc & code formatting.

	* examples/example02.m: Doc & code formatting.


===================================================
===  Release 1.0.1 : changes since release 1.0  ===
===================================================

2012-02-02  Julien Bect  <julien.bect@supelec.fr>

	Miscellaneous changes.

	* README.txt: Improved requirements and recommendations.
	* core/stk_param_estim.m: Clarified selection of optimizer.

	Improved handling of Octave packages.

	* utils/stk_check_octave_packages.m: New function to check
	for required packages under Octave.
	* stk_init.m: Added a call to stk_check_octave_packages(). Removed
	some left-overs from an earlier version of stk_init where
	fminsearch() was used instead of sqp() under Octave. Moved call to
	stk_is_fmincon_available() to the Matlab-conditional part.

	Fixed a parsing problem occuring in Octave 3.4.3 (at least),
	related to the fact that parfor loops are supposed to end with an
	"endparfor" instead of a simple "end"... but we don't use "parfor"
	at all if we are running in Octave.

	* core/stk_make_matcov.m: Moved some sub-functions to independent
	M-files stored in a private sub-folder.
	* core/private: New folder.
	* core/private/stk_make_matcov_auto_parfor.m: New file (the code
	in this file was previously part of stk_make_matcov.m).
	* core/private/stk_make_matcov_inter_parfor.m: New file (the code
	in this file was previously part of stk_make_matcov.m).

2012-02-01  Julien Bect  <julien.bect@supelec.fr>

	* core/stk_remlqrg.m: Minor bugfix: returns NaN for the derivative
	with respect to the noise variance in the case of a model without
	observation noise.  Improved error message if NOISEPRIOR &&
	~NOISYOBS (doesn't use assert anymore).

	* stk_init.m: Added a clear statement for temporary variables
	fmincon_found, octave_in_use, s and ans at the end of the script.

2012-01-30  Julien Bect  <julien.bect@supelec.fr>

	Creating maintenance branch 1.0.x.

2011-09-28  Emmanuel Vazquez  <emmanuel.vazquez@supelec.fr>

	Initial commit of STK.
