o Quick Start

    Run stk_init.m in Matlab(TM) or GNU Octave.

    Once  the STK is properly initialized,  you should be able  to run
    the examples located in the 'examples' directory.

o Requirements and recommendations for use with GNU Octave

    The STK works with GNU Octave 3.2.0 or newer.

    Note  that  the STK relies  on  some mex files  that  are compiled
    during the initialization. Thus, your installation must be able to
    compile mex files.

    The sqp() function internally relies on the GLPK library, which is
    shipped with most (but not all) versions of Octave.   The STK will
    not start if GLPK is not installed.

o Requirements and recommendations for use with Matlab

    The STK works with Matlab R2007a or newer.

    The Optimization Toolbox is recommended.

    The Parallel Computing Toolbox is optional.

o Content

    This toolbox is called the Small (Matlab/Octave) Toolbox for Kriging
    (STK). Note that  the STK is meant to be  compatible with Octave and
    Matlab(TM), and  can be automatically configured  with both software
    products. However,  some advanced features, such  as the possibility
    to use parallel computing in  some functions, are not available when
    using Octave.

    The STK is free software and  is released under the terms of the GNU
    General Public License, version 3, as published by the Free Software
    Foundation,   and   is   made   available   at   the   web   address
    http://kriging.sourceforge.net.

    By publishing this toolbox, the  idea is to provide a convenient and
    flexible research tool for  working with kriging-based methods.  The
    code of the  toolbox is meant to be  easily understandable, modular,
    and reusable.  By  way of illustration, it is very  easy to use this
    toolbox  for implementing  the EGO  algorithm  of (Jones et al. 98).
    Besides, this toolbox  can serve as a basis  for  the implementation
    of  advanced  algorithms  such  as  Stepwise  Uncertainty  Reduction
    algorithms (see, e.g., Bect et al. 2010)

    The toolbox consists of three parts:

    a. The  first part is the  implementation of a  number of covariance
       functions, and tools to  compute covariance vectors and matrices.
       The structure  of the STK  makes it possible  to use any  kind of
       covariances:    stationary    or   non-stationary    covariances,
       anisotropic   covariances,  generalized  covariances,   etc.   In
       version 1.0 of the STK, only the Matern covariance (at any order)
       is available.

    b. The  second part  is the implementation  of a REMAP  procedure to
       estimate the parameters of the covariance. This makes it possible
       to  deal with generalized  covariances and  to take  into account
       prior knowledge about the parameters of the covariance.

    c. The third part consists of prediction procedures. In version 1.0,
       the STK  has been  optimized to deal  with moderately  large data
       sets.
