This document gather various recommendations for writing code to be included in
the STK.


--- Checking the value of nargin -----------------------------------------------

Older versions of Matlab and Octave (e.g., Matlab R2007a or Octave 3.4.3) have
nargchk but not narginchk available. But the syntax of nargchk is ugly, and the
function is marked as obsolete in recent versions of Matlab (e.g., R2012a), so
we recommend using neither nargchk nor narginchk.

Testing for nargin being too small is usually a waste of time, since an error
will be issued when trying to use the absent argument.

Testing for nargin being too large is not necessary in Matlab, since this
automatically generates an error, but unfortunately the Octave developpers have
made a different choice; see:

http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Too-many-arguments-td1637206.html

The current recommendation for checking the value of nargin in STK is as
follows:

 * don't check for nargin being too small, unless there is a specific reason to
   do so,

 * check for nargin being too large this way:

   if nargin > 2,
     stk_error ('Too many input arguments.', 'TooManyInputArgs');
   end


--- Nested functions --------------------------------------------------------

Octave 3.6.4 does not support nested functions. Octave 3.8.x probably won't
support them either. So don't use them.


--- MEX-file in class directories -------------------------------------------

Octave 3.6.4 does allow to manipulate instances of user-defined classes through
MEX-files. Octave 3.8.x probably won't. So don't think of it.
