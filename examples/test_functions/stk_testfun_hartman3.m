% STK_TESTFUN_HARTMAN3 computes the "Hartman3" function
%
% CALL: Y = stk_testfun_hartman3 (X)
%
%    computes the value Y of the Hartman3 function at X.
%
%    The Hartman3 function is a test function in dimension 3, which is
%    part of the famous Dixon & Szego benchmark [1] in global optimization.
%
%    It is usually minimized over [0, 1]^3.
%
% HISTORICAL REMARKS
%
%    This function belongs to a general class of test functions
%    introduced by Hartman [2], hence the name.
%
%    The particular set of coefficients used in the definition of the
%    "Hartman3" function, however, seems to have been introduced by [1].
%
% GLOBAL MINIMUM
%
%    According to [5], the function has one global minimum at
%
%       x = [0.1, 0.55592003, 0.85218259].
%
%    The corresponding function value is:
%
%       f(x) = -3.862634748621772.
%
%    A slightly lower value is attained [4] at
%
%       x = [0.114614 0.554649 0.852547].
%
%    The corresponding function value is:
%
%       f(x) = -3.862747199255087
%
%    The exact global optimum does not appear to be known.
