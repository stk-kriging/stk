% STK_TESTFUN_SIXHUMPSCAMEL computes the "six humps camel back" function
%
% CALL: Y = stk_testfun_sixhumpscamel (X)
%
%    computes the value Y of the Hartman4 function at X.
%
%    The six humps camel back function is a test function in dimension 2,
%    which is usually evaluated over [-5, 5]^2.
%
% GLOBAL MINIMUM
%
%    According to [1], the function has two global minima at
%
%       x = [-0.0898, 0.7126]
%
%    and
%
%       x = [0.0898, -0.7126].
%
%    The corresponding function value is:
%
%       f(x) = -1.0316.
