% STK_TESTFUN_HARTMAN4S computes the scaled "Hartman4" function
%
%    The scaled Hartman4 function is a test function in dimension 4,
%    which seems to have been introduced by [1].
%
%    It is usually minimized over [0, 1]^4.
%
% HISTORICAL REMARKS
%
%    This function belongs, up to a scaling, to a general class of test
%    functions introduced by Hartman [2].
%
%    Picheny & co-authors [1] refer to Dixon & Szego [3] for this test
%    function, but it turns out that [3] only contains two sorts of
%    "Hartman functions", in dimensions three and six.
%
%    In fact, this function appears to have been obtained by truncating
%    the sum at the fourth coordinate in the six-dimensional Hartman
%    function of [3] and then rescaling.
%
% IMPLEMENTATION
%
%    This implementation has been written from scratch using [1] as a
%    reference, and then checked for correctness with respect to [4, 5].
%
%    Only minor differences, of the order of 1e-15, were observed with
%    respect to [5].  The implementation in [4], however, uses a different
%    scaling: the leading term is 1/0.8387 instead of 1/0.839 in [1, 5].
%
% GLOBAL MINIMUM
%
%    According to [4], the function has one global minimum at
%
%       x = [0.1873 0.1906 0.5566 0.2647].
%
%    The corresponding function value, with our definition of the test
%    function taken from [1]  (the one in [4] uses a slightly different
%    normalizing constant, see above)  is:
%
%       f(x) = -3.134353168721454.
%
%    Slightly better function values can be found in the neighborhood of
%    this point.  For instant, with
%
%       x = [0.18744768 0.19414868 0.558005333 0.26476409]
%
%    we get
%
%       f(x) = -3.134493969530741.
