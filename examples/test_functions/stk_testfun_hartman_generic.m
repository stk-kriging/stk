% STK_TESTFUN_HARTMAN_GENERIC compute the value of a Hartman function
%
% CALL: Y = stk_testfun_hartman_generic (X, A, P, C)
%
%    computes the value Y of the Hartman function with parameters A, P, C,
%    at the points contained in X.
%
%    The size of Y is N x 1, where N is the number of rows of X.
%
%    The parameters A, P and C should have size N x D, N x D and 1 x D
%    respectively, where D is the number of columns of X.
%
% HISTORICAL NOTE
%
%    This class of test functions has been introduced by Hartman [2],
%    hence the name.  The particular form of Hartman functions considered
%    here, however, seems to have been introduced by [1].
%
%    The only difference between the particular form considered in [1] and
%    the general form in [2] is that the weighting matrix for the quadratic
%    form in the exponential is assumed to be diagonal.

% IMPLEMENTATION
%
%    This implementation has been written from scratch using [1, 3] as
%    references (omitting the scaling in [3]).  Other implementations
%    available on the web, such as [4, 5], have only been used to check
%    the results for some special cases (Hartman3 and Hartman6 functions).
