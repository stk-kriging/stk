% STK_TESTFUN_THREEHUMPSCAMEL computes the "three humps camel back" function
%
% CALL: Y = stk_testfun_threehumpscamel (X)
%
%    computes the value Y of the Hartman4 function at X.
%
%    The six humps camel back function is a test function in dimension 2,
%    which is usually evaluated over [-5, 5]^2.
%
% GLOBAL MINIMUM
%
%    According to [1], the function has one global minimum at
%
%       x = [0, 0].
%
%    The corresponding function value is:
%
%       f(x) = 0.
