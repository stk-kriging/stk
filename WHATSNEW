Changes in version 1.2
======================

* stk_predict 
   o Now offers the possibility to compute the posterior covariance
     matrix (it is returned as a fourth optional argument).
   o Has been modified to work with non-stationary covariance functions.

* Added a new "pairwise" option to all covariance functions and also to
  stk_dist (formerly stk_distance_matrix). This options allows to compute 
  only the diagonal of the full distance/covariance matrix).

* Space-filling designs
   o New function (stk_filldist) to compute the (discretized) fill distance.
   o New function (stk_sampling_olhs) to generate Orthogonal Latin
     Hypercube (OLH) samples using the algorithm of Ye (1998).

* New (experimental) function to choose automatically the starting point for
  a parameter estimation optimization procedure (stk_param_init).

* New functions to work with boxes: stk_rescale, stk_normalize.

* More flexible representation of data
   o Improved the flexibility most functions (stk_predict, stk_param_estim, 
     ...), which are now accepting both matrices and "data structures" 
     (with an 'a' field) as input arguments.
   o New function: stk_datastruct.

* Regular grids
   o New function stk_plot2d() that serves has a wrapper around 
     {surf|contour|mesh|pcolor}-type functions, to plot data defined
     over a two-dimensional regular grid.
   o stk_sampling_regulargrid now also returns 'ndgrid-style' coordinate 
     matrices stored in new .coord field.

* Examples
   o Reorganized the example folder and renamed all example scripts.
   o New example (stk_example_misc03) to demonstrate the effect of 
     adding a prior on the covariance parameters.
   o Improved graphical outputs in stk_example_kb03.
   o New test function: stk_testfun_braninhoo (Branin-Hoo).

* Miscellaneous
   o Renamed stk_distancematrix to stk_dist.
   o Various new utility functions: stk_runexamples, stk_disp_framedtext,
     stk_disp_examplewelcome, stk_plot_shadedci, stk_octave_config.
   o Improved Octave-specific configuration.
   o Lots of bugfixes and improvements.


Changes in version 1.1
======================

* New special functions for the Matern 3/2 and 5/2 correlation
  functions (stk_sf_matern32, stk_sf_matern52). New covariance
  functions (stk_materncov32_iso, stk_materncov32_aniso, ...).

* New MEX-file to compute the separation distance (stk_mindist).

* New function to generate random Latin Hypercube Samples
  (stk_sampling_randomlhs). Renamed stk_sampling_cartesiangrid to
  stk_sampling_regulargrid, and changed the meaning of the first
  argument for consistency with other stk_sampling_* functions.

* Improved stk_model function. Now provides default parameters for
  several families of covariance functions.

* Renamed fields in "model" structures (covariance_cache to Kx_cache
  and P0 to Px_cache). A new field 'dim' has been added to the 'model'
  structure.

* Changed the order of the arguments of the functions that use the
  structure 'model'. Now, 'model' is always the first argument.

* Changed stk_param_estim to make it possible to estimate noise
  variance.

* Fixed issues in stk_param_estim.m related to the definition of the
  search domain and the selection of (constrained/unconstrained)
  optimizer.

* Renamed stk_conditionning to stk_conditioning.

* New functions for a more flexible and efficient management of STK's
  configuration in stk_init (path, compilation of MEX-file, checking
  for optional packages, selection of the default optimizer, ...).

* New functions for unit testing, based on Octave's testing system
  (stk_test, stk_runtests). Tests have been added to most functions in
  the toolbox.

* Improved documentation & new examples.

* Improved argument checking and error messages.

* Improved compatibility with older versions of Octave and Matlab.

* Lots of minor changes and bug fixes.

* Complete reorganization of the code (better directory structure).
