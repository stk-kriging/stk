Changes in version 2.0
======================

* Required Octave version number has been raised to 3.2.2.

* Important changes to the public API

   o New R-like data structures: @stk_dataframe, @stk_factorial_design.

   o The structures previously used everywhere in STK (with a ".a" field) are
     still supported but should be considered as deprecated (and will probably
     be completely removed in the next major release).

   o As a result, stk_predict () does not return a ".a/.v" structure any
     more. Instead, it returns an stk_dataframe object with two variables called
     "mean" and "var".

   o The function that computes (the opposite of the log of) the restricted
     likelihood is now called stk_param_relik instead of stk_remlqrg.

* Many improvements in the internal structure of STK, for the sake of clarity
  (for those who happen to read the code) and efficiency:

   o @stk_kriging_equation: new class for encapsulating all the basic 
     computations related to a Gaussian process (kriging) model: solving the
     kriging system, computing log-determinants...

   o The old Kx_cache/Px_cache mechanisme, for working efficiently on finite
     spaces, has been replaced by a new covariance fonction: stk_discretecov.

   o A new framework to encapsulate various approaches to parallel
     computations. Currently only supporting 'none' or 'parfor' (Mathworks' PCT
     toolbox parfor loops) engines, more to come later.

* Experimental support for parameter objects.

   o model.param is now allowed to be an object from a user-defined class. This
     feature is experimental, and not really used currently in the toolbox.

   o A new function stk_param_getdefaultbounds () has appeared in ./param, that
     was previously hidden in stk_predict (). It can be overridden in the case
     where model.param is an object from a user-defined class.

* New sampling algorithms and related functions

   o Fill-distance computation: exact (using Pronzato & MÃ¼ller, Statistics &
     Computing, 2011) or approximate (using a space-filling reference set).

   o Van Der Corput and Halton RR2-scrambled sequences (quasi-MC)

   o NOLHS designs (Cioppa & Lucs, Technometrics, 2007)

* Miscellaneous

   o misc/options: a new system for managing options

   o octave_quantile(): replacement for the missing quantile() function in base
     Matlab (Mathworks' Statistics toolbox is not a requirement of STK).

   o Add MEX-files for computing "Gibbs-Paciorek quadratic forms" to support
     future work on non-stationary covariance functions.

   o AUTHORS: a list of maintainers and contributors can now be found at the
     root of the source tree

   o stk_compile_all: now recompiles MEX-files automatically is the source code
     has changed.

   o Various new utility functions, tiny or not-so-tiny improvements,
     bugfixes here and there...
  

Changes in version 1.2
======================

* stk_predict 
   o Now offers the possibility to compute the posterior covariance
     matrix (it is returned as a fourth optional argument).
   o Has been modified to work with non-stationary covariance functions.

* Added a new "pairwise" option to all covariance functions and also to
  stk_dist (formerly stk_distance_matrix). This options allows to compute 
  only the diagonal of the full distance/covariance matrix).

* Space-filling designs
   o New function (stk_filldist) to compute the (discretized) fill distance.
   o New function (stk_sampling_olhs) to generate Orthogonal Latin
     Hypercube (OLH) samples using the algorithm of Ye (1998).

* New (experimental) function to choose automatically the starting point for
  a parameter estimation optimization procedure (stk_param_init).

* New functions to work with boxes: stk_rescale, stk_normalize.

* More flexible representation of data
   o Improved the flexibility most functions (stk_predict, stk_param_estim, 
     ...), which are now accepting both matrices and "data structures" 
     (with an 'a' field) as input arguments.
   o New function: stk_datastruct.

* Regular grids
   o New function stk_plot2d() that serves has a wrapper around 
     {surf|contour|mesh|pcolor}-type functions, to plot data defined
     over a two-dimensional regular grid.
   o stk_sampling_regulargrid now also returns 'ndgrid-style' coordinate 
     matrices stored in new .coord field.

* Examples
   o Reorganized the example folder and renamed all example scripts.
   o New example (stk_example_misc03) to demonstrate the effect of 
     adding a prior on the covariance parameters.
   o Improved graphical outputs in stk_example_kb03.
   o New test function: stk_testfun_braninhoo (Branin-Hoo).

* Miscellaneous
   o Renamed stk_distancematrix to stk_dist.
   o Various new utility functions: stk_runexamples, stk_disp_framedtext,
     stk_disp_examplewelcome, stk_plot_shadedci, stk_octave_config.
   o Improved Octave-specific configuration.
   o Lots of bugfixes and improvements.


Changes in version 1.1
======================

* New special functions for the Matern 3/2 and 5/2 correlation
  functions (stk_sf_matern32, stk_sf_matern52). New covariance
  functions (stk_materncov32_iso, stk_materncov32_aniso, ...).

* New MEX-file to compute the separation distance (stk_mindist).

* New function to generate random Latin Hypercube Samples
  (stk_sampling_randomlhs). Renamed stk_sampling_cartesiangrid to
  stk_sampling_regulargrid, and changed the meaning of the first
  argument for consistency with other stk_sampling_* functions.

* Improved stk_model function. Now provides default parameters for
  several families of covariance functions.

* Renamed fields in "model" structures (covariance_cache to Kx_cache
  and P0 to Px_cache). A new field 'dim' has been added to the 'model'
  structure.

* Changed the order of the arguments of the functions that use the
  structure 'model'. Now, 'model' is always the first argument.

* Changed stk_param_estim to make it possible to estimate noise
  variance.

* Fixed issues in stk_param_estim.m related to the definition of the
  search domain and the selection of (constrained/unconstrained)
  optimizer.

* Renamed stk_conditionning to stk_conditioning.

* New functions for a more flexible and efficient management of STK's
  configuration in stk_init (path, compilation of MEX-file, checking
  for optional packages, selection of the default optimizer, ...).

* New functions for unit testing, based on Octave's testing system
  (stk_test, stk_runtests). Tests have been added to most functions in
  the toolbox.

* Improved documentation & new examples.

* Improved argument checking and error messages.

* Improved compatibility with older versions of Octave and Matlab.

* Lots of minor changes and bug fixes.

* Complete reorganization of the code (better directory structure).
