What you will find in the 'distrib' directory
=============================================

This directory contains replacements for the cdf/pdf/rnd/... functions.

To avoid name clashes, a different naming scheme is used for the replacement
functions provided here. For instance:

 * stk_distrib_normal_cdf is a replacement for normcdf
 * stk_distrib_normal_pdf -------------------- normpdf
 * stk_distrib_student_cdf ------------------- tcdf
 * stk_distrib_student_pdf ------------------- tpdf
 * ...


Why we want/need these functions
================================

There are several reasons.

First, problems (bugs, numerical inaccuracies...) are sometimes found in these
functions and fixed in later releases of the corresponding software. To ensure
that STK runs properly on all supported releases of GNU Octave and Matlab, we
need to provide replacement for the faulty functions.

Second, we want to avoid having a depency on Mathworks' Statistical Toolbox,
which is where these functions live for Matlab users (the situation is different
with GNU Octave, since these functions are shipped with Octave itself, not in a
separate package).

Finally, having our own set of functions allows to provide some extended
functionalities, for example: a) more flexibility in the way that parameter
arguments are handles (broadcasting-like singleton expansion) and b) additional
returned value q = 1 - p for cdf functions (which allow to compute p * (1 - p) =
p * q with a good numerical accuracy even when p is close to 1).
