What is the MOLE ?
==================

MOLE stands for "Matlab/Octave Langage Extensions"

This directory is meant to contain general purpose functions that either extend
the Matlab/Octave langage or provided a replacement for a function that is
missing or buggy in one of the two langages.


Long-term goal
==============

The MOLE might one day be released as a package on its own, independently of
STK. Therefore, here, functions DO NOT have their name prefixed by stk_.


Directories
===========

./matlab contains functions that are missing in Matlab:

      o fflush
      o file_in_loadpath
      o file_in_path
      o index
      o page_screen_output
      o stdout

Other functions are provided in single-function subdirectories:

      o isoctave
      o corr
      o linsolve
      o quantile
