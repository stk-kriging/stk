What is the MOLE ?
==================

MOLE stands for "Matlab/Octave Langage Extensions"

This directory is meant to contain general purpose functions that either extend
the Matlab/Octave langage or provided a replacement for a function that is
missing or buggy in one of the two langages.


Long-term goal
==============

The MOLE might one day be released as a package on its own, independently of
STK. Therefore, here, functions DO NOT have their name prefixed by stk_.


Directories
===========

./common

   contains functions that exist neither in Matlab nor in Octave (but should, in
   our opinion). The function names must be chosen to avoid conflicts with all
   supported releases of both Octave and Matlab, which (currently) means Octave
   >= 3.2.4 and Matlab >= 2007a.

./matlab

   contains functions that are missing in Matlab:

      o fflush
      o file_in_loadpath
      o file_in_path
      o index
      o page_screen_output
      o stdout
