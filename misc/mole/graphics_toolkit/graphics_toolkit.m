% GRAPHICS_TOOLKIT indicates which toolkit is assigned to new figures.
%
% This is a (partial) replacement for the graphics_toolkit function that is missing both
% from Matlab and from some old version f Octave.
%
% CALL: NAME = graphics_toolkit ()
%
%   returns:
%    
%    * the result of get (0, 'defaultfigure__backend__') if you're running an old version
%      of Octave that does not have graphics_toolkit,
%
%    * 'matlab-nojvm' if running Matlab without the Java Virtual Machine,
%
%    * 'matlab-jvm' if running Matlab with the Java Virtual Machine.
