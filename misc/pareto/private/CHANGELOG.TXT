1.10 
* Relaxed maximisation/minimisation, so each objective in each front can be treated independently without code modification 
* Removed 3D base case, and removed copyright and attribution to Fonseca et al. 
* Greatly accelerated code: 
  - incorporated base cases for small fronts (four points or fewer) 
  - accelerated determination of reduced fronts 
  - accelerated domination checks 
  - reduced sorting costs 
  - calculated objective differences wrt reference point once only 
* Tidied-up code 

1.02 
* Accelerated domination checks 
* Corrected base case error for opt <= 1 
* Tided-up code 

1.01 
* Updated README.TXT and wfg.c with correct copyright and attribution to Fonseca, Lopez-Ibanez, and Paquete.
