% STK_SF_GAUSSCORR computes the Gaussian correlation function
%
% CALL: K = stk_sf_gausscorr (H)
%
%    computes the value of the Gaussian correlation function at distance H.
%
% CALL: K = stk_sf_gausscorr (H, DIFF)
%
%    computes the derivative  of the Gaussian correlation function  with respect
%    to the distance H  if DIFF is equal to 1.  If DIFF is equal to -1,  this is
%    the same as K = stk_sf_gausscorr (H).
%
% NOTES:
%
%  * This correlation function is also known as the "squared exponential" corre-
%    lation function, or the "Gaussian RBF" (Radial Basis Function).
%
%  * The Gaussian correlation function is  a valid correlation function  for all
%    dimensions.
%
%  * The Gaussian correlation function  is  the limit of  the Matern correlation
%    function when the regularity parameters tends to infinity.
