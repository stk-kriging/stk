% STK_PLOT_PROBDOM2D represents the uncertainty about a 2D Pareto
%
% CALL: stk_plot_probdom2d (MODEL1, MODEL2, BOX)
%
%    represents the uncertainty about the 2D Pareto front associated with the
%    minimization of models MODEL1 and MODEL2 over the domain BOX.
%
%    Use prior model structures (see stk_model) to represent prior uncertainty.
%
%    Use @stk_model_gpposterior objects to represent posterior uncertainty.
%
% EXPERIMENTAL FUNCTION WARNING
%
%    This function is currently considered experimental.  Because of the very
%    basic method used to choose the simulation points (uniform IID sampling),
%    the plots produced by this function are very unreliable representations
%    on the residual uncertainty on the Pareto front (except perhaps on low-
%    dimensional problems of moderate difficulty).
%
%    STK users that wish to experiment with it are welcome to do so, but should
%    be aware of this limitation.  We invite them to direct any questions,
%    remarks or comments about this experimental class to the STK mailing list.
