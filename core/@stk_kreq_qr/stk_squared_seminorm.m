function s = stk_squared_seminorm (kreq, zi)

% Extend the observation vector with zeros
zz = [double(zi); zeros(kreq.r, 1)];

% Compute the squared seminorm
s = zz' * (linsolve (kreq, zz));

% % Alternative (slower) implementation:
% ni = size (kreq.LS_Q, 1) - kreq.r;
% zi = double (zi);
% QU = kreq.LS_Q(1:ni, :);
% T  = kreq.LS_R \ (QU' * zi);
% s  = zi' * T(1:ni, :);

% Guard against numerical issues
if s < 0, s = 0; end
