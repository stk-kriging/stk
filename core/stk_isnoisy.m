% STK_ISNOISY returns false for noiseless models
%
% CALL: ISNOISY = stk_isnoisy (MODEL)
%
%    returns false for a noiseless MODEL and true otherwise.
%
%    MODEL is considered noiseless if:
%
%     * MODEL.lognoisevariance is missing or empty  (for backward compatibility
%       with previous versions of STK where the lognoisevariance field was
%       optional),
%
%     * MODEL.lognoisevariance is equal to -inf  (this is the default for a
%       model created by stk_model and the currently recommended way for
%       declaring a noiseless model),
%
%     * MODEL.lognoisevariance is a vector of -inf  (heteroscedastic case with
%       all variances set to zero).
