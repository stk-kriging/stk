% STK_SAMPCRIT_AKG_EVAL computes the Approximate KG criterion
%
% CALL: AKG = stk_sampcrit_akg_eval (ZC_MEAN, ZC_STD, ZR_MEAN, ZR_STD, ZCR_COV)
%
%    computes the value AKG of the Approximate KG criterion for a set of
%    candidates points, with respect to a certain reference grid.  The
%    predictive distributions of the objective function (to be minimized) at
%    the candidates and reference points is assumed to be jointly Gaussian,
%    with mean ZC_MEAN and standard deviation ZC_STD for the candidate points,
%    mean ZR_MEAN and satandard deviation ZR_STD on the reference points, and
%    covariance matrix ZCR_COV between the candidate and reference points.
%    The input argument must have the following sizes:
%
%       * ZC_MEAN    M x 1,
%       * ZC_STD     M x 1,
%       * ZR_MEAN    L x 1,
%       * ZR_STD     L x 1,
%       * ZCR_COV    M x L,
%
%    where M is the number of candidate points and L the number of reference
%    points.  The output has size M x 1.
%
% NOTE ABOUT THE "KNOWLEDGE GRADIENT" CRITERION
%
%    The "Knowlegde Gradient" (KG) criterion is the one-step look-ahead (a.k.a
%    myopic) sampling criterion associated to the problem of estimating the
%    minimizer of the objective function under the L^1 loss (equivalently,
%    under the linear loss/utility).
%
%    This sampling strategy was proposed for the first time in the work of
%    Mockus and co-authors in the 70's (see [1] and refs therein), for the case
%    of noiseless evaluations, but only applied to particular Brownian-like
%    processes for which the minimum of the posterior mean coincides with the
%    best evaluations so far (in which case the KG criterion coincides with the
%    EI criterion introduced later by Jones et al [2]).
%
%    It was later discussed for the case of a finite space with independent
%    Gaussian priors first by Gupta and Miescke [3] and then by Frazier et al
%    [4] who named it "knowledge gradient".  It was extended to the case of
%    correlated priors by Frazier et al [5].
%
% NOTE ABOUT THE REFERENCE SET
%
%    For the case of continuous input spaces, there is no exact expression of
%    the KG criterion.  The approximate KG criterion proposed in this function
%    is an approximation of the KG criterion where the continuous 'min' in the
%    expression of the criterion at the i^th candidate point are replaced by
%    discrete mins over some reference grid *augmented* with the i^th candidate
%    point.
%
%    This type of approximation has been proposed by Scott et al [6] under the
%    name "knowledge gradient for continuous parameters" (KGCP).  In [6], the
%    reference grid is composed of the current set of evaluation points.  The
%    implementation proposed in STK leaves this choice to the user.
%
%    Note that, with the reference grid proposed in [6], the complexity of one
%    evaluation of the AKG (KGCP) criterion increases as O(N log N), where N
%    denotes the number of evaluation points.
%
% NOTE ABOUT THE NOISELESS CASE
%
%    Simplified formulas are available for the noiseless case (see [7]) but not
%    currenly implemented in STK.
